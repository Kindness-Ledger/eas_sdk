# Kindness Ledger EAS SDK

## Purpose
This repository holds the open attestation schema and a small SDK and demo that turn acts of kindness into portable signals on Ethereum. Each act can be attested with a compact on chain record while media lives in IPFS and Filecoin. The goal is clarity and easy reuse.

## What is here
* Minimal attestation schema string for an act
* Demo script that can register a schema and create a live attestation on a public test network
* Environment template with all variables
* Docs with expected output and a place for proof files

## Quick start
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill `RPC_URL`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `EAS_CONTRACT`, `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`. You can also add `SCHEMA_UID` to skip registration and use an existing schema.

Choose a public test network such as Base Sepolia or Optimism Sepolia. Use a public faucet to get small test funds.

```
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm demo
```

The console should print three lines: Recipient, Schema UID, Attestation TX. See `docs/expected_output.md` for a sample. Place your own output or screenshots in `docs/proof` when a milestone is accepted.

## Read path
A light read path or tiny index will list recent attestations for an address. This is part of the next milestone.
